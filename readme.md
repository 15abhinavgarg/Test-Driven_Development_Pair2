In your work directory, checkout the repo (and submodules)
```
mkdir -p ~/workspace
cd ~/workspace
git clone --recursive https://github.com/dpiet/cpp-boilerplate
```

In your work directory, use cmake to create an Eclipse project for an [out-of-source build] of cpp-boilerplate

```
cd ~/workspace
mkdir -p eclipse
cd eclipse
cmake -G "Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-std=c++11" ../cpp-boilerplate/
```

## Import
